/**
Connection on HTTP server.

For every valid incoming HTTP request to `http_server`, a new track with all the outputs is created, and `data` output is filled with the data being received.
Once the full request is received, `success` is emitted. If any problem occurs, `failure` is emitted and `data` cease to receive more contents.

In order to process and give response to the requester, `status` and `data` inputs must be filled. `status` can be any valid HTTP code, for more informations please see the [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).
